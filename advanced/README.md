# 🔴 Advanced Track

## 🎯 Objectives

The Advanced Track is designed for participants who want to apply **deep learning techniques** on tabular data and explore model explainability. You will:

* Perform EDA with attention to class imbalance and feature interactions
* Prepare data for deep learning (embeddings, normalization, batching)
* Build and train Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)
* Apply hyperparameter tuning and regularization
* Integrate explainability methods like SHAP or LIME
* Deploy your model via Streamlit, Docker, or API-based services

---

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Setup + EDA + Preprocessing

* Perform EDA similar to Beginner Track, but focus more on skewed distributions and multicollinearity
* Encode categorical variables (integer encoding for embeddings)
* Normalize/scale numeric features
* Split dataset into train/val/test with stratification
* Convert into PyTorch `DataLoader` or TensorFlow `tf.data` pipelines

### ✅ Week 2 + 3: Neural Network Design + Model Development

* Build a baseline **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)** with hidden layers
* Include ReLU activations, Dropout, and Batch Normalization
* Train using Binary Cross-Entropy loss and Adam optimizer
* Evaluate with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC
* Track all experiments with **MLflow**
* Apply regularization and early stopping
* Tune architecture: number of layers, neurons, dropout rates, learning rate, batch size
* Use schedulers for learning rate adjustments

### ✅ Week 4: Deployment

* Save and package best model

#### Deployment Options:

* 🟢 **Streamlit**: Build a UI similar to Beginner Track
* 🟡 **Docker + Hugging Face Spaces**: Containerize and deploy Streamlit app
* 🔴 **API-based Deployment**: Use Flask or FastAPI, containerize with Docker, and deploy on Railway/Render/Fly.io/GCP Cloud Run

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

* **Data Handling & Visualization**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Deep Learning**: `tensorflow` or `pytorch`, `mlflow`
* **Explainability**: `shap`, `lime`
* **Deployment**: `streamlit`, `docker`, `fastapi` or `flask`

At the end of this track, you will have built, explained, and deployed a **deep learning model** for predicting term deposit subscriptions with modern deployment practices.
